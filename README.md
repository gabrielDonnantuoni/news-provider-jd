# News Provider RESTFUL API with Node.js, Typescript, PostgreSQL and Objection.js

## Description

This project was built on a stage of [JungleDevs](https://www.jungledevs.com/) selective process, where the original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JungleDevs/node-challenge-001)

**Challenge goal**: The purpose of this challenge is to give an overall understanding of a backend application. Youâ€™ll be implementing a simplified version of news provider API.

- REST architecture;
- Authentication and permissions;
- Data modeling and migrations;
- SQL database;
- Query optimization;
- Serialization;
- Production builds.

## Acceptance criteria

- Clear instructions on how to run the application in development mode
- Clear instructions on how to create production builds
- A good API documentation or collection
- Models created using [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)
- Login API: `/api/login`
- Sign-up API: `/api/sign-up`
- Administrator restricted APIs:
